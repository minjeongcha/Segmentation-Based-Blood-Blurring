**Segmentation-Based Blood Blurring** is a novel video processing technique that selectively blurs blood-related content based on semantic segmentation. This approach is designed to reduce viewer discomfort during gory video viewing, and our study evaluates its effectiveness using eye-tracking data.

## ðŸ§ª What is Blood Blurring?

We propose a **segmentation-based filtering approach** to detect and blur only blood regions in videos. By leveraging semantic segmentation models, we ensure that non-violent parts remain untouched. The goal is to reduce psychological aversion while maintaining content understanding.

We evaluate this method through **eye-tracking experiments**, comparing:
- Raw gory videos
- Conventional blurring (whole-frame)
- Our segmentation-based blood blurring
